gen_multiseg_golden.py

Generate golden reference data for matched_filter_multi_segment co-simulation.

Tests the overlap-save segmented convolution wrapper:
  - Long chirp: 3072 samples (4 segments x 1024, with 128-sample overlap)
  - Short chirp: 50 samples zero-padded to 1024 (1 segment)

The matched_filter_processing_chain is already verified bit-perfect.
This test validates that the multi_segment wrapper:
  1. Correctly buffers and segments the input data
  2. Properly implements overlap-save (128-sample carry between segments)
  3. Feeds correct data + reference to the processing chain
  4. Outputs results in the correct order

Strategy:
  - Generate known input data (identifiable per-segment patterns)
  - Generate per-segment reference chirp data (1024 samples each)
  - Run each segment through MatchedFilterChain independently in Python
  - Compare RTL multi-segment outputs against per-segment Python outputs

    Generate test data for 4-segment long chirp overlap-save.

    The multi_segment module collects data in segments:
      Segment 0: samples [0:1023]   (all new, no overlap)
                 buffer_write_ptr starts at 0, fills to SEGMENT_ADVANCE=896
                 But wait - for segment 0, buffer_write_ptr starts at 0
                 and the transition happens at buffer_write_ptr >= SEGMENT_ADVANCE (896)
                 So segment 0 actually collects 896 samples [0:895],
                 then processes the buffer (positions 0-895, with 896-1023 being zeros from init)

    Actually re-reading the RTL more carefully:

    ST_COLLECT_DATA for long chirp:
      - Writes to input_buffer_i[buffer_write_ptr]
      - Increments buffer_write_ptr
      - Triggers processing when buffer_write_ptr >= SEGMENT_ADVANCE (896)

    For segment 0:
      - buffer_write_ptr starts at 0 (from ST_IDLE reset)
      - Collects 896 samples into positions [0:895]
      - Positions [896:1023] remain zero (from initial block)
      - Processes full 1024-sample buffer

    For segment 1 (ST_NEXT_SEGMENT):
      - Copies input_buffer[SEGMENT_ADVANCE+i] to input_buffer[i] for i=0..127
        i.e., copies positions [896:1023] -> [0:127] (the overlap)
      - But positions [896:1023] were zeros in segment 0!
      - buffer_write_ptr = OVERLAP_SAMPLES = 128
      - Collects 896 new samples into positions [128:1023]
        (waits until buffer_write_ptr >= SEGMENT_ADVANCE = 896)
        But buffer_write_ptr starts at 128 and increments...
        The check is buffer_write_ptr >= SEGMENT_ADVANCE (896)
        So it needs 896 - 128 = 768 new samples to reach 896.
        Wait, that's wrong. buffer_write_ptr starts at 128, and we
        collect until buffer_write_ptr >= 896. That's 896 - 128 = 768 new samples.

    Hmm, this is a critical analysis. Let me trace through more carefully.

    SEGMENT 0:
      - ST_IDLE: buffer_write_ptr = 0
      - ST_COLLECT_DATA: writes at ptr=0,1,2,...,895 (896 samples)
      - Trigger: buffer_write_ptr (now 896) >= SEGMENT_ADVANCE (896)
      - Buffer contents: [data[0], data[1], ..., data[895], 0, 0, ..., 0]
                          positions 0-895: input data
                          positions 896-1023: zeros from initial block

    Processing chain sees: 1024 samples = [data[0:895], zeros[896:1023]]

    OVERLAP-SAVE (ST_NEXT_SEGMENT):
      - Copies buffer[SEGMENT_ADVANCE+i] -> buffer[i] for i=0..OVERLAP-1
      - buffer[896+0] -> buffer[0]  ... buffer[896+127] -> buffer[127]
      - These were zeros! So buffer[0:127] = zeros
      - buffer_write_ptr = 128

    SEGMENT 1:
      - ST_COLLECT_DATA: writes at ptr=128,129,...
      - Need buffer_write_ptr >= 896, so collects 896-128=768 new samples
      - Data positions [128:895]: data[896:896+767] = data[896:1663]
      - But wait - chirp_samples_collected keeps incrementing from segment 0
        It was 896 after segment 0, then continues: 896+768 = 1664

    Actually I realize the overlap-save implementation in this RTL has an issue:
    For segment 0, the buffer is only partially filled (896 out of 1024),
    with zeros in positions 896-1023. The "overlap" that gets carried to
    segment 1 is those zeros, not actual signal data.

    A proper overlap-save would:
    1. Fill the entire 1024-sample buffer for each segment
    2. The overlap region is the LAST 128 samples of the previous segment

    But this RTL only fills 896 samples per segment and relies on the
    initial zeros / overlap copy. This means:
    - Segment 0 processes: [data[0:895], 0, ..., 0]  (896 data + 128 zeros)
    - Segment 1 processes: [0, ..., 0, data[896:1663]] (128 zeros + 768 data)
      Wait no - segment 1 overlap is buffer[896:1023] from segment 0 = zeros.
      Then it writes at positions 128..895: that's data[896:1663]
      So segment 1 = [zeros[0:127], data[896:1663], ???]
      buffer_write_ptr goes from 128 to 896, so positions 128-895 get data[896:1663]
      But positions 896-1023 are still from segment 0 (zeros from init).

    This seems like a genuine overlap-save bug. The buffer positions [896:1023]
    never get overwritten with new data for segments 1+. Let me re-check...

    Actually wait - in ST_NEXT_SEGMENT, only buffer[0:127] gets the overlap copy.
    Positions [128:895] get new data in ST_COLLECT_DATA.
    Positions [896:1023] are NEVER written (they still have leftover from previous segment).

    For segment 0: positions [896:1023] = initial zeros
    For segment 1: positions [896:1023] = still zeros (from segment 0's init)
    For segment 2: positions [896:1023] = still zeros
    For segment 3: positions [896:1023] = still zeros

    So effectively each segment processes:
    [128 samples overlap (from positions [896:1023] of PREVIOUS buffer)] +
    [768 new data samples at positions [128:895]] +
    [128 stale/zero samples at positions [896:1023]]

    This is NOT standard overlap-save. It's a 1024-pt buffer but only
    896 positions are "active" for triggering, and positions 896-1023
    are never filled after init.

    OK - but for the TESTBENCH, we need to model what the RTL ACTUALLY does,
    not what it "should" do. The testbench validates the wrapper behavior
    matches our Python model of the same algorithm, so we can decide whether
    the algorithm is correct separately.

    Let me just build a Python model that exactly mirrors the RTL's behavior.
